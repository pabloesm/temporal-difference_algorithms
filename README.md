## Temporal-difference algorithms
A simple implementation in Python of classical TD algorithms, including TD(0), TD($lambda$) with accumulating traces and TD($lambda$) with replacing traces, and the recently proposed True Online TD($lambda$).
The algorithms are based on the paper of **van Seijen, H., Sutton, R. S.** (2014). *True online TD(Î»). In: Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning.*
